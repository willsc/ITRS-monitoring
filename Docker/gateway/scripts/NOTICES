Sun Microsystems, Inc. Binary Code License Agreement

for the JAVA SE DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK), VERSION 6

SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. ("SUN") IS WILLING TO LICENSE 
THE SOFTWARE IDENTIFIED BELOW TO YOU ONLY UPON THE 
CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED 
IN THIS BINARY CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND SUPPLEMENTAL 
LICENSE TERMS (COLLECTIVELY "AGREEMENT").  PLEASE READ 
THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  BY DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING 
THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. 
INDICATE ACCEPTANCE BY SELECTING THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING 
TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS, SELECT THE "DECLINE" 
BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DOWNLOAD 
OR INSTALL PROCESS WILL NOT CONTINUE. 

1. DEFINITIONS. "Software" means the identified above 
in binary form, any other machine readable materials 
(including, but not limited to, libraries, source 
files, header files, and data files), any updates or 
error corrections provided by Sun, and any user 
manuals, programming guides and other documentation 
provided to you by Sun under this Agreement. 
"Programs" mean Java applets and applications intended 
to run on the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java 
SE) on Java-enabled general purpose desktop computers 
and servers.

2. LICENSE TO USE. Subject to the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement, including, but not limited to the 
Java Technology Restrictions of the Supplemental 
License Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable, limited license without license fees 
to reproduce and use internally Software complete and 
unmodified for the sole purpose of running Programs. 
Additional licenses for developers and/or publishers 
are granted in the Supplemental License Terms.

3. RESTRICTIONS. Software is confidential and 
copyrighted. Title to Software and all associated 
intellectual property rights is retained by Sun and/or 
its licensors. Unless enforcement is prohibited by 
applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or 
reverse engineer Software.  You acknowledge that 
Licensed Software is not designed or intended for use 
in the design, construction, operation or maintenance 
of any nuclear facility. Sun Microsystems, Inc. 
disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness 
for such uses. No right, title or interest in or to 
any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun 
or its licensors is granted under this Agreement. 
Additional restrictions for developers and/or 
publishers licenses are set forth in the Supplemental 
License Terms.

4. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for a 
period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, 
as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on 
which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of 
defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  
Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  
Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under 
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to 
replace Software media or refund the fee paid for 
Software. Any implied warranties on the Software are 
limited to 90 days. Some states do not allow 
limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the 
above may not apply to you. This limited warranty 
gives you specific legal rights. You may have others, 
which vary from state to state. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS 
AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED 
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO 
THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE 
LEGALLY INVALID. 

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT 
PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR 
DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF 
OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, 
EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or 
otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software 
under this Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will 
apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the 
exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so 
some of the terms above may not be applicable to you. 

7. TERMINATION.  This Agreement is effective until 
terminated.  You may terminate this Agreement at any 
time by destroying all copies of Software.  This 
Agreement will terminate immediately without notice 
from Sun if you fail to comply with any provision of 
this Agreement.  Either party may terminate this 
Agreement immediately should any Software become, or 
in either party's opinion be likely to become, the 
subject of a claim of infringement of any intellectual 
property right. Upon Termination, you must destroy all 
copies of Software. 

8. EXPORT REGULATIONS. All Software and technical data 
delivered under this Agreement are subject to US 
export control laws and may be subject to export or 
import regulations in other countries.  You agree to 
comply strictly with all such laws and regulations and 
acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain 
such licenses to export, re-export, or import as may 
be required after delivery to you. 

9. TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS. You acknowledge and agree as 
between you and Sun that Sun owns the SUN, SOLARIS, 
JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET trademarks and all SUN, 
SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET-related 
trademarks, service marks, logos and other brand 
designations ("Sun Marks"), and you agree to comply 
with the Sun Trademark and Logo Usage Requirements 
currently located at 
http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any use you 
make of the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit. 

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  If Software is 
being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government 
or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or 
subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's 
rights in Software and accompanying documentation will 
be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in 
accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 
(for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and 
with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD 
acquisitions). 

11. GOVERNING LAW.  Any action related to this Agreement 
will be governed by California law and controlling 
U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any 
jurisdiction will apply. 

12. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement 
is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will 
remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in 
which case this Agreement will immediately terminate. 

13. INTEGRATION.  This Agreement is the entire agreement 
between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It 
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, representations and 
warranties and prevails over any conflicting or 
additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, 
or other communication between the parties relating to 
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  
No modification of this Agreement will be binding, 
unless in writing and signed by an authorized 
representative of each party.
