You have installed {{ .Chart.Name }} as a release named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}

PERSISTENCE:
{{- if .Values.persistence.enabled }}
Gateway configuration will be persisted via a PersistentVolumeClaim.

Helm will not delete the PVC if the release is uninstalled.  This allows for reinstalling
the chart and keeping your existing data - however you must use the same release name "{{ .Release.Name }}".

If you do not wish keep any data, you must manually delete the PVC.
{{- else }}
Warning: Persistence is disabled - all Gateway configuration changes will be lost if the pod terminates.
